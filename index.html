        <h2>My Field: Cybersecurity</h2>
        <p>Cybersecurity is necessary in the modern digital age to protect information of individuals and organizations from cyber threats.</p>
        <p>Encryption is likely one of the most critical principles in cybersecurity because it protects the secrecy of information by encrypting data into unreadable forms to unauthorized individuals.</p>
        <p>I enjoy cybersecurity because it gives me a chance to be thinking critically and problem-solving and to help organizations secure their data.</p>
